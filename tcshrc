# This initialization file is for those who from various reasons cannot change
# their default shell to a reasonable one.  I needed this cause at my work they
# made a brain dead decision
#      (see http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/
#       for more info - some things listed there are fixed in tcsh but
#       the main point still holds)
# to have tcsh as a default shell and it is a problem to have bash in
# your passwd entry (I was not able for example to use ftp :(( - probably
# missing entry in /etc/shells or something).
#
# So I make use of the settings done in tcsh startup files and switch right away
# to zsh/bash :)).  This make it the most useful tcshrc ever :))).  Feel free to use
# it  -- if you're newbie then do yourself a favour and take a look at
# http://www.zsh.org/ 
# or (in case you prefer bash)
# http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html
# and
# http://www.caliban.org/bash/

# The fist version had no checks at all which caused zsh/bash invocation when
# I typed 'tcsh' in the prompt line - not a bad thing :), but somehow I'm fond
# of an idea of having a freedom of shooting into my foot when I want to :P

if ($?prompt && ! $?I_WANT_TCSH) then
  foreach shell_ ($HOME/localroot/usr/bin/zsh $HOME/localroot/usr/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/bash /usr/bin/bash /bin/bash)
    if ( -x $shell_ ) then # I don't know how to make these work in one 'if'
      set version_=`$shell_ --version`
      switch ( "$version_" )
	case "zsh 4.*":
	case "*bash, version\ 3.0*":
	case "*bash, version\ 2.05b*":
	  setenv SHELL $shell_
	  break	# out of foreach loop! (breaksw is for switch)
      endsw
    endif
  end
  # This is a workaround.  Sometimes the settings done in initialization
  # scripts for tcsh gets overwritten by unmaintaned system zsh/bash
  # initialization files (like /etc/z?profile).  So I'm not using the --login
  # option and flag via env var that user login files needs to be loaded.
  if ($?loginsh) then
    setenv load_user_profile_ "true"
